# BackTREK

## Introduction
For this project I used the TREK API, using Backbone to build an application that can handle data in complex ways.

We'll be reusing the [TREK travel API](https://ada-backtrek-api.herokuapp.com/trips), [documented here](https://github.com/AdaGold/trip_api). The core purpose of the website will be the same, but we'll use Backbone to better organize our code and to provide all sorts of extra functionality.

With this application, you can add trips, view trips, and reserve trips.  It also has the functionality to let you filter trips by price, name, continent, category, duration and id.  

## Setup
1. Clone the repository
2. Install depenencies in your repository
```
yarn install
```
3. Serve front end with Webpack
```
yarn start
```
## Learning Goals

- Generate HTML using Underscore templates
- Use Backbone and jQuery to work with a complex API
- Manage application data using Backbone models and collections
- Build an attractive, robust, and feature-rich user interface
